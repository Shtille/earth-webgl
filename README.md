# Earth WebGL

*Earth WebGL* is a site made for viewing Earth.

## View options

### Simple view
An original site with Earth rendered with pretty and physical correct shaders. Earth is just a sphere mesh.

### Compicated view
A complicated approach to render Earth as a cube projected onto sphere. Each cube face is represented by a quad tree. Each node contains a tile that is being generated by one of two schemes.
A level of detail is calculated automatically depending on the current camera position.

## Tile generation schemes
Its tiles are being generated by two ways:
* rendered by the [frontend](https://github.com/Shtille/earth-webgl) (this site)
* rendered by a [backend](https://github.com/Shtille/earth-tileserver)

Both ways are controlled by a single settings file _res/settings.json_.

### Frontend tile generation
Frontend tile generation is the least wanted option because of performance.
Use following settings:
```json
{
	"serverUrl": null
}
```

### Backend tile generation
Backend tile generation scheme is the most want one.
Use similar settings:
```json
{
	"serverUrl": "http://localhost:9000"
}
```

## Dependecies
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
NPM was originally used to pack the sources into a single file. But for a moment a module based structure is used.
